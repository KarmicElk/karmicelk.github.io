title: New Blog!

Here is the first post on my new blog! I've decided to start one to document my thoughts while learning about the field of cybersecurity and penetration testing.

It was a bit of a process getting this up and running as I had no idea what I wanted to use as a platform. I've read about some security issues with WordPress and didn't want to use a Blogger site. I stubled upon GitHub Pages by accident one day while browsing Reddit and decided to give it a try. It took me a bit to get it going as I've never used GitHub and needed to learn about how repositories and forking worked. Once I got that figured out I was able to find a Jerkyll theme I liked and boom, my blog was created.

It will definitely be a process to get my thoughts down on paper, but I think it will be valuable and fun to look back and see where I started. My writing will also hopefully improve as I keep creating these posts.
