title: Starting Up - Security+
---

Where do I see myself in 10 years? Am I happy doing deskside support until I retire? Is my work challenging me? Have I become stagnant?

These are the questions I was asking myself a few months ago when my girlfriend and I had a conversation about our careers. I came to the realiazation that I was becoming stagnant (and a bit complacent perhaps) with my career. The thought of continuing to do deskside support until I retired was unappealing, especially since I already have one of the best deskside roles at my current job. The position, while great, was not doing something critically important: it was not challenging me to continue learning.

Once I realized this, it gave me to motivation to get back into that student mindset and start learning some new things. At the same time, coincidentally, my department started encouraging us to put forth development plans for ourselves which could include funding for some courses. During college, I took and passed the original CompTIA Security+ SY0-101 certification. That certification was only valid for three years, and had long since expired. Since it was my favourite course out of all my courses that year, I decided to set that as my first development goal.

Diving back into that course made me realize how much I enjoyed the security part of information technology. I liked the thought of using that knowledge to help protect people from threats to their digital life. The one section that really interested me was the penetration testing section; learn how to hack systems so that you can protect them from those same attacks. Security+ only briefly touched on some of the concepts, but I was intrigued. Maybe this is the career path for me? Theres always new exploits and vulnerabilities being found technology. Could I be one of those people that finds one?

After a few months of studying, I wrote and passed my Security+ SY0-501 exam. The exam itself was more difficult than I was expecting, but I was able to pull through with a comfortable passing score. I was elated that I passed and was excited to start learning more about the penetration testing world.
