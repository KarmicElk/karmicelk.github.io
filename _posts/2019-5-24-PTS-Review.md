title: Penetration Testing Student and eJPT
---

A few days ago I completed the eLearnSecurity Penetration Testing Student (PTS) course by passing the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester certification exam (eJPT). I really enjoyed the course materials and the hands-on, practical nature of the exam. Here is my mini-review of the course/exam and some of the things I liked and some I disliked.

Note: eLearnSecurity (eLS) recently updated PTS from version 3 (2015) to version 4 (2019). I finished version 3 of the course and wrote my exam right before the changeover. eLS was kind enough to upgrade me to version 4 at no cost since I had recently taken the course. I will start going through the new version to see what was added and update this post.


What is it?

The PTS course is a beginner level course for those who are interesting in becomming a penetration tester. It indroduces methodology, concepts, and basic tools that are used during the course of a penetration test. This course is recommended as a pre-requisite for the eLS Penetration Testing Professional (PTP). I've also read that it is a great primer for Offensive Security's OCSP course as well.


Course Materials

The course material consists of three categories: slides, videos, and labs. I greatly enjoyed all of the materials in this course. The slides are in a HTML5 player which saves your current position in the slide deck. This was great for quick, random study sessions as I didn't have to go hunting through the slides to where I left off. The slides had lots of screenshots and walkthroughs which was great when watching the videos weren't an option (like when I was at work).

The videos were excellent at reinforcing the concepts taught in the slides, and gave step-by-step walkthroughs of tools and methods. I frequently went back a re-watched videos to brush up on a concept or find a missed step for a tool I was using. The audio was crystal clear and the narrator was easy to understand.

The labs have been my favourite part of this course. Being able to actually go into an evnviroment and try out the tools/methods really helped with my learning. It didn't matter if I broke anything (which I did) as I could just reset the lab and try again. The lab manual gave clear instructions on how to access the lab and configure the lab settings. Each lab was its own "session" where you had to download an .ovpn file and connect to the session with OpenVPN. Each lab would have its own manual outlining the goals of the lab and giving you the solution if you happened to get stuck. Redoing the labs was basically all I did to study for the exam. I re-did each lab at least five times to really understand what each one was trying to teach me.

eLS does have a forum area where students can post questions and answer questions from other student. This was valuable as I was able to find resolutions for issues I was having with specific exams. The eLS staff is frequently in there answering questions and providing feedback without spoiling the labs.

Version 4 of the course has added a few more slide decks, videos, and labs. I haven't had a chance to go through everything yet, but they have added three "black box" labs to use as exam practice. This appears to be the biggest addition, and one I'm excited to spend some time with. I only wish I had these before I wrote my exam!


The eJPT Exam

The exam is performed using the same setup as the labs. Once the exam starts, you have three days in the lab environment to answer 20 questions based on your findings. I thoughly enjoyed the exam as it definitely challenged my knowledge on everything taught in the course. There were a couple things that stumped me during the exam, but I was able to figure it out eventually and pass the test. That was the most rewarding part for me: getting stuck but pushing through and finishing the exam. Once you submit the exam, your results are given immediately. I passed!


Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed this course, from the lab materials to the exam. It was so refreshing to complete a course that was based on practical labs and not just regurgitating knowledge. I look forward to taking more eLearnSecurity courses in the future!
