OSCP! OSCP! OSCP!

There was a recurring theme that kept appearing while I was researching on how to get into the field of penetration testing: OSCP. It was mentioned over and over again through many Reddit posts and security blogs I stumbled upon: Netsec Beginner Help; New to NetSec; Career Change Question. Stories of triumph and utter failure. What was this OSCP thing they were talking about?

They were talking about something called the Offensive Security Certified Professional, a widely-recognized industry certification. The course pre-requisites seemed light: Understanding of TCP/IP? Check. Reasonable understanding of Linux? Check. Familiar with bash/python/perl? Not check, but it can be learned. The course overview looked jam packed full of fun looking things, and the course cost wasn't bank-account emptying. Reddit and various blogs, however, painted a different picture: tales of agony and defeat; a 24 hour soul crushing exam; a detailed exam report of each task you performed. This required more research...

After reading all these stories, I started to branch out to blogs with tips/tricks/guides to passing this monster of an exam. What I quickly realized was that my current state of technical knowledge was woefully inadequate for this certification. I had very basic and limited programming skills, and very basic understanding of the Linux command line. The sheer amount of things I needed to learn was staggering and overwhelming. Where do I even begin? How do I prioritize the things I need to learn?

I ended up finding a beginner course from eLearnSecurity called Penetration Testing Student (PTS), which was a perfect way for me to gently enter the world of penetration testing. The course slowly introduced me to the basic concepts and tools that pentesters use for enumeration and exploitation. In addition, I found a beginners course on Linux that helped me learn some of the basic commands to use in the Linux command line.

I'm currently finshing up the PTS course, and will be writing the exam in the next few weeks. I still feel a bit overwhelmed with the information I need to learn, but I'm taking it one step at a time.
